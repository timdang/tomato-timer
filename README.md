# Tomato Timer

Tomato Timer is a implementation of the Pomodoro Technique of time management. The Pomodoro Technique breaks work down in to 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minute breaks.

Once you execute this package, it will let you work for 25 minutes before creating a modal box that can't be dismissed for 5 minutes, forcing you to take a break from coding.
